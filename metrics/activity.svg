                                            Okay, thanks. But the only reason I use mcstatus for DNS info, is because you already have the code I wanted to write to check SRV and other stuff.
Also, creating my own subclass means I'll have to check each time to see if anything in
                                            <code>__init__</code>
                                            has changed on update. I can of course automate this, but it doesn't seem like good practice.
                                        </i>
                                        Indeed, It's not, but again you shouldn't be storing the entire class just for DNS info, the only reason I suggested that, was to give you a solution that doesn't break your compatibility. The custom class is a lot better, but again, you shouldn't even be storing a class, just use a named tuple with host and port, or store them as attributes direcly in your class.

                                        I don't see how this is an issue with mcstatus though. I agree that separating DNS functions to make things like this easier is a good thing to do for cases like these, I personally don't think we should make the ip validation optional though since again, it just causes issues and we don't really have any good reason for doing that. If you need something like this on your side, why don't you just make a subclass, override our behavior and be done with it?

<span class="token trimmed">(4 more lines were trimmed)</span></code>
                                        This way you get exactly the behavior you were looking for without any need to alter the library code, which requires this validation to be there. But it's up to you to debug any potential errors if they occur because the address was invalid in case you were using functions that require it. To circumvent that, you could implement any of the proposed solutions (bool flag with a function that blocks all other if false set by another function or running the check before each function making a connection), or something else if you can think of it. Though you don't really need it for your use-case, so it's up to you to implement those, just know that not doing that may cause issues.
What I'd actually suggest though is just not storing
                                        <code>MinecraftServer</code>
                                        class as "dns_info" parameter, that's not what this class is for at all, the
                                        <code>lookup</code>
                                        function does perform some DNS logic to get the port if it wasn't specified and there's an SRV record, however that's just the initial logic, you don't need the actual class for that, all you care about is really just the obtained host and port after this lookup.
This would mean you'd have to change your
                                        <code>ServerInfo</code>
                                        class and change everything that uses it, but that's not really an issue of mcstatus. You don't need to do that, you could just go with the custom class and it would allow to to keep everything as it was, but your original method wasn't great in the first place. What you could also do is making
                                        <code>MinecraftServer</code>
                                        -like class, except all it would do is store the
                                        <code>host</code>
                                        and
                                        <code>port</code>
                                        and contain the DNS lookup logic, perhaps with the use of PR 203 separated functions once it's merged. This would also allow you to preserve your original logic without that many changes. It's a bit weird to have a class just for dns info, but it would mean you wouldn't really need to change anything except maybe some typehints. (Unless you actually were using some other features of that class)
                                        <code class="language-multiline language-py" xml:space="preserve"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">DnsInfo</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>

<span class="token trimmed">(11 more lines were trimmed)</span></code>
                                        What may actually be worth doing is making
                                        <code>lookup</code>
                                        -like staticmethod that just performs this logic but it only returns the host and port, instead of a full class instance, since even with the DNS logic now separated, it's still non-trivial to implement this and we could just call this from the original
                                        <code>cleanup</code>
                                        . I don't know how should a method like this be called, but it may be worth doing.

                                        Why don't you just handle for that exception with
                                        <code>try-except</code>
                                        block then? You can simply catch the errors which the check is raising. That way, you don't need to use
                                        <code>socket.gethostbyname</code>
                                        and you can instead rely on our RFC compliant regex instead. This will also make your code faster since I've noticed you were doing this from an async function and even though DNS lookups aren't slow, it's certainly not great to have a blocking synchronous DNS request in an asynchronous function.
Handling these exceptions shouldn't be hard at all, we only raise TypeErrors or ValueErrors, but I've said this earlier. Is our logic really so unreliable that you need to be using
                                        <code>socket.gethostname</code>
                                        instead of the regex? If so, why? I didn't see anything wrong with it from my testing (though it wasn't that extensive). And because we're using unique exceptions for each case (or at least a unique description), you can know exactly what error has occured, catch it and handle it in any way you want.
Nevertheless, if you just need to perform the DNS lookup, you shouldn't even need to construct an entire instance of
                                        <code>MinecraftServer</code>
                                        . You can just check if you have a port, and if not, you can just perform the DNS lookup logic, mimicking what
                                        <code>lookup</code>
                                        is doing, but without making the actual instance, and therefore avoiding the initialization checks alltogether. Because of this I made the #203 PR, which should fix your issue by moving the DNS lookup function(s) out of lookup and it can now be performed without making a full instance easily.
We simply can't remove these checks from
                                        <code>__init__</code>
                                        , because doing so would just get too messy and would require us to instead run the check before each function that actually makes any connections, which is too slow and pointless if it can just be done once at initialization. Alternatively, there could be another function that makes these checks and sets a bool flag that's required and just check that in these functions, but again, that would end up cluttering the code a lot, and just isn't worth doing in comparison to having a simple check on init. Not doing that at all is also not an option because as I've said several times now, it leads to exceptions which aren't easy to track back and are very unintuitive. But I've said this already too, granted though it wasn't in the context of this issue.
